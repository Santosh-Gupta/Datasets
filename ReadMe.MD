# Computer Science Summaries

This this was such a big project, I gave these datasets their own page here

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/ScientificSummarizationDataSets

Update 7-20-19

I have forked several Github repos to set them up to train on the data, and then created accompanying Colab notebook which shows how to use the repos to process and training on the data. For abstractive summarization, I have selected summarization repos which use the Transformers architecture, and the Pointer-Generator architecture. And for extractive summarization, I have selected a Bert-based architecture.
